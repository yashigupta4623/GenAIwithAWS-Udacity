AI is computing simulating human interlligence processes. These processes includes learning, reasoning, self-correction and even potential for creativity.

AI > ML >DL

Usage of AI :
- Smart Cities : Manage traffic flow, Reduce energy consumption.
- Healthcare : Assist in Diagnosis.
- Farming : Drones montior crops, Optimising yields.

ELIZA, a computer program created in the 1960s, was one of the first programs designed to have a conversation with people.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves simulating human-like reasoning and cognitive processes in computers, aimed at creating systems capable of performing tasks requiring intelligence when done by humans. These tasks include:

Recognizing patterns.
Speech recognition.
Decision-making.
Making predictions.

In AI, the goal is to replicate human learning and decision-making processes by creating sophisticated computer programs that can:

Process vast data.
Learn patterns.
Make informed decisions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is subtly integrated into our daily lives, making tasks simpler, more efficient, and personalized. It's often unnoticed, termed as "silent" AI. Examples include:

Auto-tagging in social media.
Fraud detection in banking.
Recommendation systems in music playlists or online shopping.
Smart thermostats adjusting temperatures.
Ride-sharing apps optimizing routes and prices.
Wearable devices monitoring health metrics.

Alexa is an AI-powered virtual assistant housed in an Amazon Echo Dot device. Alexa can:

Understand and process voice commands.
Make informed decisions.
Learn from user interactions to improve its responses over time.
Alexa uses AI to:

Recognize speech patterns.
Understand context.
Predict user preferences for personalized content.


The 8 Dimensions of Responsible AI
To build AI that people can trust, we need to think about these key areas:

1. Fairness: AI Should Treat Everyone Equally
Imagine you ask Alexa, “What are the best colleges near me?”, but it only recommends colleges for a certain group of people, leaving out others. That would be unfair AI.
2. Explainability: AI Shouldn’t Be a Black Box
If you ask a chatbot, “Why did you give me this answer?”, and it can’t explain itself, that’s a problem.
3. Privacy & Security: AI Should Protect Personal Data
4. Transparency: AI Shouldn’t Hide How It Works
Ever used an app that randomly changes its recommendations without telling you why? That’s a lack of transparency.
5. Robustness: AI Should Work Even in Unpredictable Situations
6. Governance: AI Should Follow Rules & Ethical Standards
7. Safety: AI Shouldn’t Cause Harm
8. Controllability: Humans Should Stay in Charge
AI should never be completely out of human control. 

Why Should You Care About Responsible AI?
AI is shaping the future of education, jobs, social media, and even healthcare.
If you use Alexa, chatbots, or recommendation systems, you’re already interacting with AI every day.
As future leaders and AI creators, you have the power to help build fair, safe, and transparent AI systems.
By keeping these 8 dimensions of responsible AI in mind, you can help create AI that benefits everyone.
